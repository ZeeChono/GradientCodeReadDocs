Welcome to Gradient Coding Simulation's documentation!
======================================================

**Abstract**

This document describes the basic AWS EC2 cluster work flow setup for the Gradient Coding Simulation.
It relies on the Python scripting language and the support from the `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_. 
This document consists of three sections:  

- Report
- Cluster setup
- Run simulation


Check out the :doc:`cluster_setup` section for further information on AWS setup, 
and checkout to the :doc:`run_simulation` section for how to run the code.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
